    "Using what we've seen about loops and conditionals, there are two tasks. The first task is to write some code that plays the game 'FizzBuzz'. FizzBuzz is a common test given in coding interviews. All you need to do is write some code that goes through the numbers 1-100, and, where a number is divisible by 3, print Fizz, 5, print Buzz, and both, print FizzBuzz, in other cases just print the number. For instance, for 3, the code should print Fizz, for 5 Buzz, and for 15 FizzBuzz, and for 8, just 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "It shouldn't be too hard to write some code that does it, but two write good clean code that does it will be harder. Some things to remember are: using suitable variable and iterator names, writing fewer lines of code where possible, wirting suitable comments for your code, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second task is harder, and will test another important skill, your ability to google. I want you to write some code that simulates a coin flip and produces a heads or a tails. I would like you to write that code such that it keeps running until the number of heads produced by the code is the same as the number of tails. As an extension, it would be a good exercise to try packaging it up in a function, AND, running the simulation multiple times to find an average number of flips needed for the number of heads to equal the number of tails.
