We can also store more complicated things like classes and operations, we won't worry about the complex things now though. Let's first of all look at how variables can store individual items of data, and some of the quirks of that."

Dataframes is one of the key ways of working with tabular data in Python. To use them, we need to import the package that has them to our workspace. It's called pandas. Every time we use the package, we'd have to tell Python we want to, bu calling 'pandas' but this is a bit long to do over and over, so the accepted way is to import pandas as pd, and we can use pd as short for pandas. This will become clear as we go.\n",

For now, we'll build up our skills by hard coding them from scratch, first using dicitonaries. In this case, we will make a dictionary, with each key being a column, and all the values in lists being the values in that column per row."
