    "This file conataains the session notes for lession 5 of the course. in this session we cover some more coputer science type concepts like if/else statement, looping, and writing functions. The focus of this session specificaly is how we use loops to perform repeated tasks and how wre can next one loop inside another. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is one of the sloweer programming languages in terms of run time. This means that loops are often not tht eefficient, pqarticularly when we are nesting lost of loops inside each other. As a result while loops are incredibly useful to perform iterations we should be mindful about how heavily we use them. That said, the runtime of loops only becomes a big problem when we are running quite large and complex tasks, for small scale data tasks it shoudl be fine. \n",
    "\n",
    "In programming we shouold aim to reducve how much we type out cvode and repeat ourselves. The acronym DRY stands for Dont Repeat Yourself and is a common saying in programming. in esseng programming is really the process of creating lots of different functions and combining them in a way to perform the task that we need.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of programming is incredibly usefull when it comes to trying to automate reports. For exampel when trying to draw on data from multiple sources with multiple formats, functions can be set up to deal with specific errors or complications and these can be ran every time the same issue apearts using if/else conditions to catch them.\n"
